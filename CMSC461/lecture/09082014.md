# Databases - Formal Relational Query Languages - 09/08/2014

## Intro to the Relational Algebra
The relational algebra is a procedural query language based on set theory. Since
the output is a relation, you can easily build complex queries.

### What is the difference between procedural and non-procedural languages?
In procedural languages, you describe how you want to retrieve your information.
Non-procedural or declarative languages allow you to describe the data you want,
not how to get it.

### Six Basic Operations
* select
* project
* union
* set difference
* cartesian product
* rename

#### Select Operation
Takes an relation as an input parameter and specifies a selection predicate.
Returns all tuples that verify for that predicate. The number of relations input
is the same number output.

#### Project Operation
Takes a relation and returns a subset of the attributes in that relation.

#### Union Operation
Union combines two relations **IFF** they are union-compatible: same number of
attributes and compatible domains.

#### Set Difference
Taking two relations R and S, set difference returns a relation containing all
values in R that do not exist in S. Same requirements as union.

#### Cartesian Product Operation
Takes two relations R and S and returns a relation containing a combination of
all values in R and S. If the relations are not disjoint, renaming is necessary.

#### Rename Operation
Allows us to rename attributes in a relation. Useful for creating cartesian
products of non-disjoint data.

### Composition of Operations
In most cases, we can combine operations to create complex queries.

### Additional Operations

#### Set-Intersection Operation
Given two relations R and S, it returns a relation where R and S intersect.

#### Natural Join Operation
Given two relations R and S, and returns a relation where the attributes are
equal, and removes all duplicates.
