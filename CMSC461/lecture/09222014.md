## SQL Operations:
* rename
* string operators
* set operations
* aggregate functions

### When do you use the rename operation?
* Aggregate functions.
* Relations

### String Operations.
How would you select **dept_name** from **instructor** where **dept_name** is
"Comp"? `select * from instructor where dept_name like "Comp%"`

### Aggregate Functions
Find the average salary of instructors in each department.
`select dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary from instructor`

### Scalar Subqueries
Scalar subqueries typically return a single value, usually using aggregate functions.

## Modifications of a Database

### Deletions
`delete from r where P;`

This deletes whole tuples, and you can only delete on one relation at a time.

### Insertions
Insertions can be singular or multiple. You have bound by the domains of the
relation.

```sql
insert into course values (...)
insert into course(...) values(...)
```

### Updates
If you already have data in a relation, you may want to change it without
deleting it. Updates can be conditional, and can be done with scalar subqueries.

## Joins
Join operations take two relations and return a new one.

Join is a Cartesian product operation that requires that the relations have the
same attributes.

* Natural join: returns whatever is in common between relations.
* join with using clause: similar to natural join except not all attributes that
    are the same are joined upon.
* join with on condition: similar to using where clause, but behaves differently
    in outer join. Not constrained to attributes having the same name.

### Outer Joins
Outer joins are an extension of join that avoids loss of information. Add tuples
to the relation where the two originals do not match, using null values.

NOTE: MySQL doesn't support full outer joins. Deal with it.
